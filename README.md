## 📜 About Me
- **200+ hours** in Python — from quick scripts to proper modular projects.
- **Data & AI Foundations** — basic understanding of algorithms, data handling, and neural nets.
- **Video Game Development Enthusiast** — exploring engines, mechanics, and storytelling in code.
- **Prompt Engineering** — crafting precise, high-performance prompts for AI models to deliver exactly what's needed.

I approach development like a field operation: plan the mission, choose the right tools, execute with precision, and adapt when things inevitably go sideways.
